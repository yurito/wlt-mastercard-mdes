  title: MDES Digital Enablement API
  description: |
    These APIs are designed as RPC style stateless web services where each API endpoint represents an operation to be performed.  All request and response payloads are sent in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data-interchange format. Each endpoint in the API specifies the HTTP Method used to access it. All strings in request and response objects are to be UTF-8 encoded.  Each API URI includes the major and minor version of API that it conforms to.  This will allow multiple concurrent versions of the API to be deployed simultaneously.
    <br><br>
    **Authentication**
    <br><br>
    Mastercard uses OAuth 1.0a with body hash extension for authenticating the API clients. This requires every request that you send to  Mastercard to be signed with an RSA private key. A private-public RSA key pair must be generated consisting of:
    <br><br>
    1. A private key for the OAuth signature for API requests. It is recommended to keep the private key in a password-protected or hardware keystore.
    <br>
    2. A public key is shared with Mastercard during the project setup process through either a certificate signing request (CSR) or the API Key Generator. Mastercard will use the public key to verify the OAuth signature that is provided on every API call.<br>

    An OAUTH1.0a signer library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastercard/oauth1-signer-java)
    <br><br>
    **Encryption**
    <br><br>
    All communications between Issuer web service and the Mastercard gateway is encrypted using TLS.
    <br><br>
    **Additional Encryption of Sensitive Data**
    <br><br>
    In addition to the OAuth authentication, when using MDES Digital Enablement Service, any PCI sensitive and all account holder Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data must be encrypted. This requirement applies to the API fields containing encryptedData. Sensitive data is encrypted using a symmetric session (one-time-use) key. The symmetric session key is then wrapped with an RSA Public Key supplied by Mastercard during API setup phase (the Customer Encryption Key). <br>

        Used to digitize a card to create a server-based Token. MDES will
        perform both card availability and eligibility checks to check that this
        specific card is eligible for digitization. As both availability and
        eligibility are combined, only a Tokenization Authorization message is
        sent to the issuer as part of this request to authorize the
        digitization. No Tokenization Eligibility message is sent. The
        digitization decision will be one of Approved or Declined.

      operationId: notifyTokenUpdate (for token state change)
      summary: Outbound API used by MDES to notify the Token Requestor of significant
        Token updates, such as when the Token is activated, suspended,
        unsuspended or deleted; or when information about the Token or its
        product configuration has changed.
      description: >
        This API is used by MDES to notify the Token Requestor of significant
        Token updates. Typical notification scenarios include


        1. Informing the merchant a token is active

        2. Informing the merchant a token has been suspended by the Issuer

        3. Informing the merchant a token has been unsuspended by the Issuer

        4. Informing the merchant a token has been deleted by the Issuer

        5. Informing the merchant of a product configuration change (such as a change in Card Art)

        6. Informing the merchant of underlying changes to the FPAN metadata associated to the token


        **Connection Security**


        Mastercard will connect via TLS protocol and verify the server certificate before establishing a connection to the client endpoint. During this handshake, the client server can request TLS client authentication. Mastercard will present a client certificate which identifies as ?ws.mastercard.com? This client certificate is issued by the Entrust L1K certificate and should be available in most trust stores.



        **Conditional Objects**


        The contents of the notifyTokenUpdated API will vary depending which of the above scneraios triggered the notification.


        1. *productConfig* - Provided when Product Configuration has changed (e.g. such as card art).

        2. *tokenInfo* - Provided when either the details of the token or associated FPAN have changed (such as token or PAN expiry).

         The optional objects will always contain a minimum set of data which be returned regardless of whether or not updates have been made. These fields are denoted as required fields.

        Asset will not change. If contents do need to change (for example,
        Issuer has supplied new artwork for a product), they will be updated in
        the repository and be assigned a new Asset ID.  Different types of
        Assets are supported in the repository, such as images and text files;
        and for each type of Asset, multiple formats may be supported. For
        example, a single image Asset may be supported in various file formats;

        appropriate format to use for a particular target device.
